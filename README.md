I’ve shared a detailed breakdown of the entire day, names, stories, and notes here.

**"From Anxious to Aligned – My Unforgettable Day at the ‘Data as a Product’ Event"**

*What. A. Day.*

I’m still buzzing with energy from yesterday. Some days you remember for life—not just for what you learned, but for how you felt. This event was one of those.

From debating *“Should I even go?”* to building real, meaningful connections…
From *“I don’t know anyone here”* to *“I really got to know my community”*...
From wondering *“What even is dentsu, Merkle, CDC?”* to proudly thinking *“Now I’m part of it.”*
The transformation I experienced in just a few hours was surreal.

☀️ *Let’s rewind to the start...*

The event was scheduled to begin at 10:30 AM. I arrived at 9:55 AM sharp—just like the instructions said. Surprisingly, the venue was quiet at that time. You know that feeling when everything’s still, and your brain starts overthinking?

🎵 *“Anxiety, I feel it quietly, tryna silence me…”*
Oops. That song was on loop in my head.

But then came the turning point…

☕ **Meeting Harshit Bhai**

I met **Harshit Srivastav Bhai**—someone I’d already followed online, but this was the first in-person interaction. He made everything instantly comfortable. We grabbed a chai and chatted about something very close to every aspiring data professional’s heart: **how to approach applying for opportunities**. His dedication really struck me—especially knowing he came all the way from a place near Kochi just to attend the event. That set the tone for the day: **intentional, passionate, and purpose-driven**.

🎮 **The Ice Breaker: The Connexion Game**

The event officially kicked off with a fun icebreaker called **"The Connexion Game"** by **Sai Raam**. It was more than just a warm-up—it was a reminder that connection is the core of both people and data.

Then **Harish Vishwa Senthil** took over to introduce the panel members, share the purpose of the event, and give a shoutout to all the wonderful staff who made this day possible. The room, which was once quiet, suddenly felt alive.

🧠 **Vinay Sir – The World of dentsu**

Next came **Vinay Mony Sir**, who gave a brilliant introduction to **dentsu**, the powerhouse behind the event. I didn’t know much about them before, but here’s what I learned:

* **dentsu** is a global advertising and digital marketing company, originally founded in Japan over **120 years ago**.
* It’s one of the oldest and largest marketing agencies in the world.
* In India, dentsu operates across various sectors—creative, media, customer experience, data, and analytics—under the brand **dentsu India**.
* They also acquired **Merkle**, a global leader in data-driven performance marketing, strengthening their data and identity capabilities.

What truly amazed me was how dentsu is not just thinking about ads or campaigns, but how **data and human impact** can work together.

❤️‍🔥 **Project Humanity – Where Tech Meets Purpose**

One of the most touching moments was learning about **Project Humanity**, an initiative by **dentsu Labs**. It’s a project designed to help **people with hearing impairments**. They’re building tech that translates sound into **vibrations and visuals**, allowing those with hearing challenges to experience communication in a new, empowering way.

This wasn’t just “cool tech.” It was a reminder that when we treat data as a product, **the user matters more than the data**. It’s all about building solutions that change lives.

📊 **From Coarseness to Clarity: Data’s Journey to Value**

Vinay Sir also dove into the core topic—how data evolves into a valuable product. He explained two important concepts:

* **Data Coarseness to Product Value**: Raw, unrefined data—like scattered logs, unstructured feedback, or sensor readings—can be messy and unclear. But through processing and modeling, it becomes part of something useful: a dashboard, a recommendation engine, or an insight for decision-making.

* **Data Density to Customer Value**: High-density data (where a lot of context and attributes are captured) is gold. For example, instead of just knowing a user clicked a product, knowing their behavior across channels, time spent, past purchases—that’s the real juice that drives customer-centric product design.

🧠 **Enter Merkury – Person-Based Identity Revolution**

The last major insight was around **Merkury**, a tool by Merkle (now part of dentsu), which is all about **person-based identity resolution**. It helps businesses unify fragmented customer data across platforms—so instead of guessing “who” did “what” across devices, brands get a clear, privacy-safe, real-time understanding of each user.

This is the future of **customer analytics**, and it was exciting to get a peek into the tech stack behind it.


**Event Reflection: ‘Data as a Product’ – Turning Conversations into Insights**

An incredibly insightful event titled **"Data as a Product"**—a panel discussion featuring seasoned experts who’ve spent decades navigating the evolving data landscape. What stood out was how each speaker brought a different lens to the idea of treating data not just as a byproduct of business operations, but as a valuable **product in itself**—something that must be designed, developed, governed, and maintained with purpose.

Let me walk you through the key insights shared by the panel members, each of whom had a unique perspective to offer.

🌐 **Debasree Bhattacharya – AVP at Dentsu (20+ years of experience)**

Debasree ma’am opened the session by setting the foundation: when we say *Data as a Product*, we’re essentially talking about managing data just like we manage any other digital product—complete with its **lifecycle, governance, security, and feedback loops**.

She emphasized that **agile methodologies** are not just for software anymore. Data teams, too, must operate in sprints, continuously delivering value. Her experience highlighted the importance of aligning data work with client-specific needs and business outcomes. She pointed out how teams should function as **internal advisors**, understanding not just what data exists, but what questions need to be answered using that data.

A very interesting portion was on **data security and governance**. She shared that in today’s environment—especially when dealing with **customer data**—we can’t afford to just “move fast and break things.” Whether it’s **open data** shared externally or **raw data** being processed internally, everything needs to be handled with robust governance policies.

She also spoke about **pre-production** and how early testing, comparison models, and **feedback analysis** are crucial before rolling out any data product. The concept of **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** was also explored—not just as a deliverable but as a strategy to validate data usefulness before scaling.

📊 **Chethan KT – Project Manager, Analytics & BI at Bayer (18+ years of experience)**

Chethan sir brought a deeply analytical flavor to the conversation. He opened with a thought-provoking line: *"Today’s data analyst is no longer just a number cruncher—they’re storytellers, domain experts, and decision enablers."*

He emphasized the importance of being **domain-specific and user-focused**, especially in sectors like **healthcare**, where data isn’t just about numbers—it’s about lives. He gave an example from Brazil’s healthcare system, explaining how **geo, weather, and bio-data** are being integrated into decision-making.

Chethan stressed that **KPIs** must be crafted with business goals in mind, especially in **micro-industries** where standard metrics may not apply. His talk dove deep into **data pipelines**, and he advocated for ensuring **data quality and cleaning** at every stage. “You can’t expect magic from messy data,” he said.

Interestingly, he discussed the use of **mathematical principles** in modeling and even touched upon **prompt engineering**, a skill becoming more relevant with AI tools in the mix. His mantra for data teams: make solutions **sustainable and scalable**, ensuring that data flows smoothly **upstream and downstream** across departments.

What truly inspired me was his call for **cross-collaboration** and being genuinely **passionate about data**, even when the job gets challenging. It reminded me that the human side of data—the curiosity and communication—is just as important as the technical side.

💡 **Ramya Rajendran – Associate Director at LTI Mindtree (15+ years of experience)**

Ramya ma’am brought both structure and humor to the table. Starting with the theme of *Agile as applied to data*, she reimagined **Scrum frameworks** through a data lens. “Think of sprint planning not just in terms of features, but as incremental data enhancements,” she said.

She highlighted the classic project triangle—**Scope, Time, and Cost**—as still being relevant, especially when working on data design. The biggest challenges, however, are not tools or timelines, but **mindset and communication**. Data teams often face resistance not because the tech isn’t right, but because people aren’t aligned.

To lighten the mood, she joked about the overabundance of cheap online data courses ("**99/- fake data course**"), reminding us to stay skeptical and focus on real learning.

She spoke passionately about being the **outlier**—a phrase that resonated deeply with me. In a world full of averages, we need data professionals who think differently. Her experience with **aviation engine data** showed how even legacy industries are using **digital data** to transform operations.

One of the standout points was about **unique agile adaptations** for data teams, where once again, **mindset** and **WSJS (Why Should Justify Story)** came into play in project management. She wrapped up with a nod to MVPs—reminding us that quick, smart delivery can pave the way for more impactful, long-term solutions.


**"Breaks, Bonds, and a Bit of Ras-Malai – The Second Half of a Memorable Data Event"**

After the knowledge-packed first half, we moved into a short break—or at least what was supposed to be 10 minutes but blissfully stretched to 20. And honestly, those 20 minutes turned out to be one of the most enriching parts of the day.

☕ **Break That Built Bridges**

As the break began, we grabbed a breather, freshened up, and then did something truly valuable: **we connected**.

Here are some of the amazing individuals I had the privilege of meeting:

* **Sourav Kumar Sahoo** – A recent graduate now working in the HR domain. It's always interesting to see how data is making its way into every field, even HR.

* **Bobbiti Vishnu Kumar Reddy** – Another recent pass-out, currently working on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. A technically strong guy with great insights.

* **Saravanan Balakrishnan** – A UI/UX designer, curious about data. His genuine interest in understanding *where and how data is used* was refreshing. Always love when cross-domain curiosity sparks!

* **Sasapu Praveen** – A data analyst by role and a recent graduate. It was great to exchange a few thoughts on tools and workflows.

* **Arjun Rathod** – From Maharashtra, like me! A science educator with a background involving Microsoft products. (Correct me if I’m wrong, Arjun!) Love how education and tech meet in your journey.

* **Basavarajeshwari R Mathapati** – A molecular biologist by profession, now transitioning into the data world. Your story is incredibly inspirational, Basava! I regret not getting to hear more about your journey—looking forward to that someday.

* **Mathav K** – Working in the **embedded domain** within the **automotive industry**. We had a great chat about his roles and responsibilities, which I found super relevant given my own automotive interests.

* **Uday Bhaskar Maddala** – With 5 years of experience, he brought calm and clarity to the conversations. We didn’t get to speak much, but I appreciate his openness to sharing about challenges and opportunities.

* **Pavan Kumar Patil** – From **Merkle, a dentsu company**, he talked deeply about the company’s work culture and it gave me an insider’s view.

* **Adiilfaizan Razvi** – Full of energy and also part of the event organizer team! I was particularly curious about your insights into the **freelancing domain**—definitely want to explore that more with you.

🌟 **So Many People, So Little Time**

It honestly felt like a single day wasn’t enough to meet and understand everyone’s story. Each person I met had a different background, but all were united by curiosity, drive, and a love for data.

If I’m honest, I didn’t enter this event with a clear goal in mind. That might be why I missed out on some valuable moments—like wanting to speak to **Raghavan P** about data analyst roles in the **automobile industry** (a domain I’m personally passionate about), or talk to the **event organizing team** about what goes into running such a smooth event.
Note to self: Next time, go in with intent.

🧠 **Quiz Time – My Favorite Part!**

Ah, the quiz! This part was pure joy.

At first, I thought it might be intense. But as the first question appeared, I realized—it wasn’t a stress test; it was a **fun, reflex-based knowledge game**. With every question, my interest kept building. It was smart, interactive, and honestly, just plain fun.

When prizes were handed out to the **top five scorers**, **Sai Raam** asked a brilliant question:
**“How many of you winners made a new connection today? Can you share their name or something about their story?”**
That struck a chord.

It’s not just about winning. It’s about whose story stayed with you. And that’s when I realized—**if your story resonates, your name is remembered**.

🗣️ **Panel Q\&A – Missed but Not Forgotten**

Unfortunately, during the attendee Q\&A session, I wasn’t able to fully listen in. But from the conversations I caught, some topics discussed were:

* **Agile methodology**
* **Microsoft Copilot**
* **Company-specific working methodologies**

I noted the keywords but missed the details. Something to catch up on later.

🍽️ **Lunch – Much Needed, Much Loved**

By 1:30 PM, it was lunch time—and believe me, I was starving. The highlight?
**Mango-flavored Ras-Malai.** Absolute satisfaction. 🍮💛

More stories were exchanged over plates. This was a quieter, more personal kind of bonding time—and I enjoyed every bite and every conversation.

🙏 **Gratitude and Goodbye**

As the day came to an end, I was filled with appreciation:

* To the **hospitality staff**, thank you for guiding us from the gates to the event hall and ensuring everything ran smoothly.

* To the **panel members**, I honestly don’t have the words. You didn’t just share knowledge—you shared energy, focus, and passion. Thank you.

* To the **Chennai Data Circle** and the **organizing team**, I’m so grateful for the opportunity to be part of something so thoughtfully executed.

* And finally, to **Dentsu Global Services**, thank you for making this event **impactful**, inclusive, and unforgettable.
